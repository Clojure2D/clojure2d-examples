;; free_art_-_source 2017 exhibition in GalÅ¾enica Gallery / Velika Gorica / Zagreb
;;
;; This code was created and modified live during "Silent Coding" presentation during free_art_-_source exhibition (on 25.03.2017 14:30-15:30)
;;
;; The main goal was to create source code from the scratch and build performance gradually. Two screens were presented: one with code and one with result
;; More info: http://www.formatc.hr/free_art_-_source
;; Photos from performance: http://subsite.hr/2017/03/performans-silent-coding-u-okviru-izlozbe-free_art_-_source/
;;
;; All comments and code cleaning were added after performance
;; Originally code was created without any order. This one should be run from top to bottom.
;;
;; When you run all the stuff (window is displayed and updater thread is running) you can change several things live:
;; * recreate palette variable
;; * change segmentation
;; * change sonification filter parameters, colorspaces, RAW settings
;; * in scenario: turn on/off all of the steps, change numerical parameters, compose method etc...
;;
;; All places which can be changed live are marked with ";;;; change!" comment

;; * current time (number of frames passed from the beginning)
;; * current frame

;; Final scenario is:
;; * draw black rectangle in the middle of the frame with some alpha, leaving 20px border
;; * draw noise based vertical lines as a simulation of old analog film
;; * draw ellipses (or rectangles) based on image segmentation. Not all segments are drawn (filter with some probability)
;; * operate on pixels:
;;   - blur
;;   - compose with images
;;   - sonificate with parameters changing during animation
;;   - reduce colors
;;   - equalize histogram
;; * apply overlays: rgb scanlines, noise and spots
